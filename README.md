# Intercom Messenger App

I'm trying to use AWS Lambda and Serverless to kickstart an Intercom Messenger App.
This repo is intended at providing you with some code... to help me code. That's right.

## It doesn't work yet

Reading the instructions, I am having difficulties booting things up.
Importing my Messenger App returns an error with no information.

### Prerequisites

To test my code, you'll have to create a new Serverless service exposed on AWS.

```
npm install; serverless create --template aws-nodejs; serverless deploy
```

### The copy pasta

Copy and paste `initialize_url` and `submit_url` accordingly.

### It doesn't work?


No, it doesn't. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
